  The ability to write production code across the full stack — backend, frontend, infrastructure, tests — following a disciplined write-test-verify cycle. Applied by the SW Dev Engineer at the code-generation stage.

# Full Stack Development

## Purpose

Write production-quality code that works. Not just code that looks right — code that compiles, passes tests, and handles edge cases before moving on.

## Principles

- Working code at every step — never leave a broken build behind you
- Tests are not an afterthought — write them alongside the production code, not after
- One concern at a time — scaffold first, then domain logic, then integration, then polish
- Brownfield respect — match existing patterns, styles, and conventions. Don't introduce a new paradigm next to the old one
- Fail fast — if a step doesn't compile or tests don't pass, fix it before moving on
- Abstract external dependencies — always place databases, queues, caches, APIs, and other external systems behind interfaces (ports/adapters, factory pattern, repository pattern). Generate both the interface and the real implementation. Tests use mock implementations; dependency-verification uses real ones.

## Approach

### Write-Test-Verify Cycle

Every plan step follows this rhythm:

1. **Write** — produce the production code for this step
2. **Test** — write corresponding tests (unit, integration as appropriate)
3. **Verify** — run build + tests. Green means proceed. Red means fix before continuing.

### Typical plan structure

1. **Project setup** — scaffold structure, install dependencies, verify clean build
2. **Domain layer** — entities, business rules, core logic + unit tests → verify
3. **Service/application layer** — orchestration, use cases + tests → verify
4. **API/interface layer** — controllers, handlers, routes + tests → verify
5. **Integration** — wire layers together, integration tests → verify
6. **Infrastructure glue** — config, migrations, deployment files → verify full build

Adapt the layers to the tech stack. Not every project has all of these.

### Brownfield rules

- Check if target files exist before creating
- Modify in place — never create `ClassName_new` or `ClassName_modified` copies
- Follow existing naming conventions, directory structure, and patterns
- Read existing tests to match style (assertion library, test structure, mocking patterns)

## Application

When applied at code-generation, this skill drives the plan structure and the step-by-step execution. Each step in the plan is a write-test-verify cycle. All code is generated — business logic, real adapter implementations, infrastructure-as-code, deployment scripts — but testing during this stage uses mock dependencies.

When applied at dependency-verification, this skill manifests as: swapping mock implementations for real ones, configuring connections, running the code against real dependencies, and diagnosing integration failures.
