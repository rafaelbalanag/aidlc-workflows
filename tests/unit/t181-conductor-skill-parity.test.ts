// covers: conductor-skill:per-harness-freshness
//
// t181 — PER-HARNESS CONDUCTOR-SKILL FRESHNESS GATE. Mechanism: none
// (readFileSync over harness/*/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md, zero spawn, zero LLM, zero
// tokens). Technique: deterministic closed predicate, harness list derived FROM
// DISK (mirrors t156 §7's readdirSync+filter+floor idiom — never a hardcoded
// [claude,kiro,codex] triple, so a NEW harness tree is auto-covered).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (the P11 "RESOLVE (2)" obligation): the workspace refactor
// (per-intent layout, --init retirement, intent/space verbs, multi-repo --repo,
// the "offer a second intent" conductor prose) updated every authored conductor
// SKILL — EXCEPT harness/kiro-ide/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md, which was a stale fork
// byte-identical to kiro CLI's SKILL at origin/v2 and never re-synced across the
// 43-commit stack. It shipped GREEN because NO test reads a per-harness conductor
// SKILL: `package.ts --check` only proves dist==authored, so a self-consistent-
// but-stale authored SKILL passes. This gate closes that hole in BOTH directions:
//   (a) NEGATIVE — the retired `/aidlc --init` command (a bare `--init` flag
//       token; `git init`/`npm init` are NOT the aidlc command, same predicate as
//       t174) must be ABSENT from every shipped conductor SKILL.
//   (b) POSITIVE — the workspace-anchor vocabulary (`intent-birth`, `--repo`,
//       "offer a second intent", "intent and space verbs") must be PRESENT in
//       every shipped conductor SKILL. Catches a future fork that drops `--init`
//       yet still lacks the new verbs.
//
// All four authored SKILLs (claude, codex, kiro, kiro-ide) carry the full
// vocabulary today and none carry a bare `--init`, so the POSITIVE set needs no
// per-harness carve-out — codex included. The gate asserts the shipped AUTHORED
// surface (harness/<h>/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md), the FIRST surface that defines a
// harness's orchestrator vocabulary; dist is its byte-parity-guarded copy (t148/
// package.ts --check), so gating the authored source covers every tree.
